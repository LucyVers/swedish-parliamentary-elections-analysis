# Swedish Parliamentary Elections Analysis - Task Status

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Document ALL implementations immediately after completion:
- Update documentation in docs/README.md (not the project root README)
- Document technical choices and decisions
- Add code comments
- Update this TODO list

## CURRENT FOCUS: Remaining G-Requirements üö®
These must be completed first:

### Education Data Integration (Current Focus)

#### 1. Data Verification & Preparation
- [x] Verify data conversion process:
  - [x] Run education_data_converter.js
  - [x] Verify CSV output format
  - [x] Confirm all 290 municipalities are included
  - [x] Document any missing or problematic data

- [x] Verify municipality name matching:
  - [x] Compare with existing election data municipalities
  - [x] Test normalizeKommunName function consistency
  - [x] Create list of any problematic matches
  - [x] Document matching methodology
  
  Implementation completed ‚úÖ:
  - [x] Municipality name standardization successful:
    - [x] Fixed mismatches for Lilla Edet, Upplands V√§sby, and √ñstra G√∂inge
    - [x] Verified all 290 municipalities match perfectly
    - [x] Documented fix in PROGRESS.md
    - [x] Enhanced name normalization for spaces and special characters

#### 2. Visualization Implementation
- [ ] Create Google Charts visualizations for education data
  - [ ] Document visualizations and their purpose
- [ ] Connect education data with election results
  - [ ] Document data flow and connections
- [ ] Find and analyze correlations between education and voting patterns
  - [ ] Document analysis methods and results
- [ ] Add narrative explanations for findings
  - [ ] Document conclusions and reasoning

### Narrative Improvements
- [ ] Enhance explanatory texts for all visualizations
- [ ] Improve story flow between different analyses
- [ ] Add context to data presentations

## NEXT STEPS: Remaining VG-Requirements ‚≠ê
To be addressed after G-requirements are met:

### Additional Analysis Needed
- [ ] Add second additional data source (beyond education data)
  - [ ] Document data source and integration decisions
- [ ] Investigate causality for correlations
  - [ ] Document methodology and results
- [ ] Perform two-point T-test
  - [ ] Check normal distribution
  - [ ] Document any outlier removal
  - [ ] Document statistical methods

### Interactive Features to Add
- [ ] Implement dropdowns for data filtering
- [ ] Add sorting capabilities
- [ ] Enhance data exploration tools
  - [ ] Document all new interactive features

### Advanced Implementation Needed
- [ ] Complex data integration between all sources
- [ ] Multi-database synchronization
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive technical documentation
- [ ] Security measures documentation
- [ ] Database configuration security
- [ ] Git security verification

## COMPLETED: G-Requirements ‚úÖ
