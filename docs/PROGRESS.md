     - `src/`: Source code
  - `tasks/`: Task management
  - `backend/`: Server and database configurations

### Project Goals
1. **Basic Analysis (G-krav)**:
   - Present clear visualization of 2022 election results
   - Show basic comparison with 2018 results
   - Investigate correlation between average income and voting patterns
   - Present findings in a clear, linear narrative

2. **Extended Analysis (VG-krav)**:

### Development Tools and Quality Control

To ensure data quality and facilitate development, I created two essential tools:

#### 1. Municipality Name Analyzer
This tool is critical for data quality and matching:
- **Purpose**: Ensures consistency of municipality names between education and election data
- **Features**:
  * Compares municipality names across data sources
  * Identifies spelling differences
  * Verifies presence of all 290 municipalities in both sources
- **Usage**:
  * Quality control during data import
  * Name matching troubleshooting
  * Verification after data updates

#### 2. Database Inspector
A tool for inspecting all data sources:
- **Purpose**: Provides overview of available data across all databases
- **Features**:
  * Displays SQLite data (county information)
  * Displays MySQL data (geographic information)
  * Displays MongoDB data (municipality and income data)
  * Displays Neo4j data (election results)
- **Usage**:
  * Quick overview of available data
  * Data structure verification
  * Database connection troubleshooting

These tools are essential for:
1. Data quality assurance
2. Development troubleshooting
3. Documentation for future developers
4. Verification during data updates
