# Project Progress Log

## Setup Phase

### 2024-03-20
1. Initial Project Setup
   - Created project directory structure
   - Initialized documentation
   - Created TODO list and task tracking system
   - Set up project organization structure

2. Project Structure
   - Created the following directories:
     - `data/`: For storing election data and other datasets
     - `docs/`: Project documentation
     - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
     - `src/`: Source code
     - `tasks/`: Task management and TODO lists

3. Next Steps
   - Awaiting download of Version 7 statistics template
   - Need to review "Using Data from Multiple Data Sources" exercise
   - Will initialize Git repository after template review

### 2024-03-XX
1. Project Components Integration
   - Moved and renamed database configuration file:
     - From: `course_materials/templates/Konfig_fil_för_Statistic_template_V7.txt`
     - To: `backend/config/database_connections.json`
   - Successfully tested server (localhost:3005)

2. Project Structure Understanding
   The project consists of three main components that work together:

   a) Main Assignment (in `assignments/`)
   - Project goal: Create narrative about 2018/2022 parliamentary elections
   - Requirements: Use Statistics Template V8 and multiple data sources

   b) Exercise Materials (in `resources/`)
   - Contains "Using Data from Multiple Data Sources" exercise
   - Provides example code for database connections and queries
   - Serves as learning tool and template for our project

   c) Database Configuration
   - Linus's file provides access to all required databases:
     - SQLite: County information (Wikipedia)
     - MongoDB: SCB statistics (demographics/income)
     - MySQL: Geographic data (Lantmäteriet)
     - Neo4j: Election data (val.se)

3. Next Steps
   - Verify all database connections work
   - Study exercise code examples
   - Begin implementing analysis based on exercise learnings

## Decision Log
- Project language: English (for international accessibility)
- Documentation structure: Markdown files for easy version control
- Task management: Using categorized TODO list with status tracking
- Database configuration: Centralized in backend/config for better organization
- Project documentation: Maintaining clear connection between components
